## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed and configured.
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android development, including SDK tools).
* A Google Cloud Project with the Google Sheets API enabled.
* A Google Service Account JSON key file.
    * **Crucial:** Ensure your Service Account has **Editor access** to your Google Sheet.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/flutter-cafe-stock-tracker.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/flutter-cafe-stock-tracker.git)
    cd flutter-cafe-stock-tracker
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Configure Google Sheets API:**
    * Open your Google Service Account JSON key file.
    * Copy the values for `"private_key_id"`, `"private_key"`, and `"client_id"`.
    * Open `lib/main.dart` in your project.
    * Locate the `_serviceAccountJson` string.
    * **Carefully paste** your `private_key_id`, `private_key`, and `client_id` into the respective fields. Pay close attention to `private_key` as it's a multi-line string.
    * **Update `_spreadsheetId`**: Change `'1wlQHhw_vdMKA38hu_ydhnIFAVSCQuZV5Dh79eOrq9Vk'` to your actual Google Sheet ID.
    * **Verify `worksheetName`**: Ensure `'Sheet5'` matches the exact name of your worksheet tab.

4.  **Generate Launcher Icons (Optional but Recommended):**
    If you want a custom app icon, add your `app_icon.png` (preferably 1024x1024) to `assets/app_icon.png`.
    Then, add `flutter_launcher_icons` to `dev_dependencies` in `pubspec.yaml` and configure it:
    ```yaml
    # pubspec.yaml
    dev_dependencies:
      flutter_launcher_icons: "^0.13.1" # Check pub.dev for latest

    flutter_launcher_icons:
      android: "launcher_icon"
      ios: true
      image_path: "assets/app_icon.png"
      web:
        generate: true
        image_path: "assets/app_icon.png"
        background_color: "#ffffff"
        theme_color: "#ffffff"
      windows:
        generate: true
        image_path: "assets/app_icon.png"
      macos:
        generate: true
        image_path: "assets/app_icon.png"
    ```
    Then run:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    dart run flutter_launcher_icons
    ```

### Running the Application

* **For Web (fastest for development):**
    ```bash
    flutter run -d chrome
    ```
* **For Android (debug APK):**
    Connect an Android device or start an emulator, then run:
    ```bash
    flutter build apk --debug --split-per-abi
    ```
    You'll find the APKs in `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/`.
